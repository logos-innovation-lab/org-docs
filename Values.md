# Intro
I think when it comes down to it, most people would agree that being alive is good, because the alternative is unknown at the very least, and oblivion likely. But regardless of ones philosophical belief about what comes next, what we know now is "reality" exists, and therefore we exist to experience it. 

Now one could argue that we cannot know for sure we exist. Perhaps we are in a simulation as Elon Musk suggests. But logic and reason cannot exist without existence existing first. So we might as well agree that "this is life and we're actually experiencing it" as a first principle, otherwise nothing can be explained. Literally nothing could make sense.

So if being alive is good, perpetuating life is also good. And in order to do that, humans need things to survive — products and services. Looking at it from a different angle, life is active. If we lay still and do nothing, we cannot expect to stay alive. We need food, water, shelter, and clean air to breathe as bare minimums. 

But then life without the opportunity to thrive — to experience love, connection, and purpose might not be worth living. So there is a hierarchy of needs, from essential for life, to essential for thriving. The former is non negotiable, but as you work up Maslow's pyramid, each level's value is subjectively determined by the individual seeking it.

The needs to sustain life are clear, particularly physiological needs. Without air, we will die in minutes. Without water, days. Without food, weeks. Without shelter we are subject to our environment providing a habitable climate. If it doesn't, we die. And so on.

# Social Versus Antisocial Procurement
So then, life must be active. We must pursue that which sustains us. For example let's look at food. Without it we will quickly die, so time is of the essence. 

**Here are the options for how one may procure food:**

- Grow it
- Gather it
- Buy it (trade)for it
- Steal it
- Regulate for it

**These options can logically be broken down into two categories, social and antisocial actions.**

### Social
Social action are those that do not physically hurt or coerce. Antisocial actions are the opposite, and I argue that the only moral actions are social. Why? Because if life is good, and therefore perpetuating life is good, if you hurt someone or take their stuff you are prohibiting them from perpetuating their own life.

Also, if you look at it from a psychological perspective, being social is in our DNA. No one person is good at everything, we're all predisposed to unique acumen. So we must work together to achieve the best for ourselves, our families, our communities, and the world. We must be social to entice each other to work together. Otherwise death follows, either from warring factions trying to take from each other, or from inaction.

To get back to food procurement, social actions are growing, gathering, and trading. Why? Because they are voluntary actions. Growing and gathering are self evident, but trading denotes two parties exchanging things they agree are equally valuable, at the time of their trade. It doesn't matter if the trade is good for good, good for service, or good for a medium of exchange. Both parties must want and agree to a deal before it consummates.

### Antisocial
Antisocial actions include theft, and regulating. Again the first, theft, should be self evident. When you steal you are limiting the ability for someone else to perpetuate their own life; a moral wrong. But from a moral standpoint the robber who steals directly through threat of violence is only a fraction worse than a person who employs someone to steal on their behalf. The initial voluntary transaction between thief and the one who hires them does not make the end result more morally tolerable. Therefore both parties, the one who hires and the one who takes, are party to the same immoral action.

To take it one step further, a group of thieves performing a heist is not morally better than an individual doing the same. Nor is a group acting on behalf of someone who hires them, able to remain on moral footing. What if a group of thieves is acting on behalf of someone who asks them nicely? Or a group acting on behalf of another group who get together and votes the bandits into theft? These are both  morally corrupt since the end result is violence towards a peaceful person trying to perpetuating their own life.

# Markets Are Moral, The State Cannot Be
If growing and gathering are beyond our abilities or interests, and theft is wrong, then trade is the optimal solution to procuring the goods and services we need to perpetuate our own lives. Trade occurs in markets, so therefore markets are moral as long as they exist to provide voluntary exchange. And any voluntary exchange is moral, as long as it does not result in violence or coercion towards a peaceful person.

### The State Is Blah When Held Up To The Beauty Of Markets
Though not necessary for explaining the virtue of markets, it is sometimes helpful to compare the antithesis. In this case it's "The State". The State, which represents various systems of governance from democracy to dictatorship, is at its core a monopoly on violence. The only question is how many people get to wield that authority. 

How can you test whether or not you are living under a monopoly of violence? Simple, try to opt out. Will you be subject to enforcement? Under state rule any law that gets ratified must have an enforcement mechanism, otherwise it does not have to be followed. Why ratify it in the first place? 

Enforcement might look like a warning, a fine, or capture. But no matter where it starts, state enforcement can only have one terminus — the threat of a gun. No matter if you believe the law is moral or not, if you break it you will be subject to enforcement. If you push back the severity will increase to its ultimate end; your end.

To make matters worse, The State cannot own anything it does not steal from someone else — be it funding in the form of taxation, or land in the form of eminent domain. So in order for the state to build a road, or fund unemployment, it must commit an act of violence first. Theft.

That is why markets are so beautiful. They represent humans sustaining themselves and their communities through cooperation. Through mutual benefit. Through creativity, hard work, and social interactions. Through voluntary exchange. And both parties benefit, because the exchange cannot happen otherwise.

Humans need goods and services to survive, and there are two ways of distributing them. Markets, which are voluntary and social, and theft which is violent and antisocial. We build markets to promote peaceful, voluntary, social behavior. Ultimately for a better world.
