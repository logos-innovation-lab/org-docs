## Defining the problems we can solve

### Approach
I would like to create an overarching story, like a comic book story set in a not to distant dystopian future (spoiler alert: we're already in it).

Inspiration: https://halo.electriccoin.co/

**Story**
In this future, you own nothing, you "lease" everything, even the money you think you have is not under your control. All your contacts and communications are monitored, trading of services and goods are in the hands of a few big corporations while the state has become a small and corrupted organisation that only in perception still slightly resembles the original vision and mission. Politicians are nothing more than figure heads; celebrities who are to ugly for show business. 

In this future, you loose control over your **identity**, who you want to be or how you want to be seen in this world; **privacy**. You don't have a choice in choosing a symbol to express **value** in, nor do you have the tools to **store** your created value over a long period of time. Everything you think or say is monitored by the attention economy and because you are aware of this, **self-censorship** is the normal social behavior. You even have to be careful about what you create, the product of your labor might be **stolen** (taxes) or even outright **outlawed** (tornado cash).

In this story, we follow our protagonist who is waking up to the reality of not being free at all. She starts looking for others who think alike and needs tools to communicate, to create, to trade, to have access to value (cash) to survive in the urban jungle. 

As these tools become available to her, a new hope arises, a new way of organising the human endeavour comes into focus. 

**We create a cyberpunk story from which we can extract cypherpunk ideology/technology and build it for real.**

### Rant/Ramblings

I believe strongly that it will take a storytelling / entertaining ecosystem to have a chance of beating the old corporations (banks, internet companies).

By now, people are conditioned to live in apple or google ecosystems, which comes with a specific lifestyle. After all, the tools we are using shape our personal experience of reality. 

The reason people are not easily swayed from social media etc is because they're addicted to it. Addiction can only be solved by healing the cause of the addiction, which is mostly being in emotional distress. 

It is my belief this first world people distress is coming from loosing touch with reality. In reality though, they're suffering from the distress that comes with unconditioning.

In order to save humans from their insecurities and therefore sensitivity to addiction, sorting out the emotional distress is key. We can do this by creating and telling a story people can reflect themselves in, find likeminded people, discover the crossover between story and reality. 

Google and Apple literally show their users who their peers are, and how to use and behave with their tools and technologies. This gives the user a feeling of comfortably being in control of their environment (even if you're in a car crash).

Logos users will use our products and ecosystem because it will provide them with value, not taking value from them. And because they look forward to the evolution of the neo-futuristic storytelling, they are emotionally engaged. 

Like product placement in a tv show, the apps, technologies and tools in the story exist in the real world and can be engaged with. The lifestyle can be emulated. 

As our protagonist discovers a new possible reality, our ecosystem will grow.

### Keywords
Privacy, anonymity, freedom of speech/trade/gathering, non-censorship

### Distill the problems
In general:
- Users don't own their identity nor data 
- Users don't own their platform (dapp) and do not profit in value creation
- Users don't have anonymity 
- Users don't have privacy
- Users aren't conditioned in behaviour and tool use so have no clue who to be or what to do in the ecosystem

**Identity**
- Nowadays most people see their identity as a sum of instagram selfies.
- No privacy
- No anonymity

**Social Comms**

- Everything they publish can be censored
- Self-censorship is rampant because of the chilling effect 
- Every expression becomes like one sausage of sameness because of algorithm & shit culture

**Messaging, Task Management**

- Highly risky to single point of failure
- Exit cost huge
- walled gardens 

**Marketplaces, Shops**

### Portray solutions
**Identity**

**Social Comms**
Before one can act, they need inspiration to know how to act or what to act on. 

**Messaging, Task Management**
When wanting to collaborate, communications and organisational tools are needed.

**Marketplaces, Shops**
When wanting to trade the fruit of the collaboration

### Limiting our canvas
We are limiting our canvas to a glass plate-like interface, nowadays referred to as a smartphone or a tablet / computer, or a touch screen on a machine.
We are strongly focussed on using Logos and Status as our main media.
