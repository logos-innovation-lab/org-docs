# Logos Lab (LL): A collaboration with Logos DAO

## Overview

### TL/DR
Logos offers a compelling dev stack for decentralized apps. Logos is in need of a passionate, mission-driven prototyping org to imagine and innovate useful projects that can be turned into revenue-generating products. That's LL — we're a match made in the ether!

### About Logos DAO
Logos DAO is a vibrant community-based dapp and blockchain ecosystem that empowers user-driven economies. It runs on the Logos decentralized stack which features messaging, storage, and crypto transactions using an EVM.

### About Logos Lab

Logos Lab (LL) promotes the Logos DAO vision by creating dapp prototypes using the Logos stack, with built-in token economies. 

**These prototypes are delivered with a business plan to make future development of the community and their tooling sustainable.**

Along with a prototype and business plan, LL also delivers immersive content that will be used to draw communities together. Technology with incentives aligned towards peaceful interactions, plus a compelling story will manifest peaceful, collaborative, prosperous communities. 

**We believe people inherently want these types of communities to exist — they want permission-less, private, efficient, low-cost coordination (there is a market need) and are anxiously awaiting tools they can use to build them.**

As an example, decentralized marketplaces with built in context-specific reputation will finally decouple the peer-to-peer economy from centralized third parties. The broken promise of Ethereum is that decentralized marketplaces do not yet exist. We wish to remedy this using the Logos stack.

### LL Mission
LL prototypes open source technology that promotes peaceful coordination using the Logos stack, so humans can voluntarily find each other, communicate, and transact value.

### Benefits to Logos
Our collaboration benefits Logos in these ways:
- LL provides Logos with a steady stream of innovation with a brand and business plan, that can then be developed into market-scale, revenue-generating products. 
- There will be ~6 projects over the course of 3 years, building on the work we're delivering for Status right now (Boardwalk), including "Tasks", and "P2P-Share".
- LL battle-tests the Logos stack from a user's perspective, so Logos devs can iterate and improve it.
- LL, as a small independent team, operates outside the Status corporate structure. Because of this we are flexible and fast, and are able to dream big and bold, taking moon-shots that internal teams may not be free to take.
- LL embodies the cypherpunk values found in the early days of blockchain technology. It is our life's calling to build decentralized tools for human empowerment. The work we do (open/publicly) will positively impact Logos' reputation.
- LL helps mitigate the risks associated with large-scale, full-org pivots that bet on unproven initiatives. We internally prototype and test so Logos can commit resources on initiatives that pass initial business/technology scrutiny.
- LL is uniquely qualified for this task — a small team skilled in creating technology, design, branding, and story.

### What success looks like
LL will be a success if, over the course of 3 years, we deliver 6 open-source, decentralized app prototypes (MVPs) with business plan, branding, and supporting content.

### Caveat
While LL has a ton of control over our own success, we are dependent on the available technology. Decentralized coordination tools like marketplaces require decentralized storage and chat. We will do our absolute best with what we have to work with. 

We also believe though separate from Logos, we are pulling in the same direction. With that in mind we will work in the spirit of collaboration to achieve scalable decentralized tech together.

### Other risks
- **Personnel**: LL is a small team made up of specialized people. For whatever reason should the need arise, replacing one of them might prove challenging. If this occurs we will leverage Logos' network as well as our own to help find talent.
- **We're on the bleeding edge**: Things go wrong or take longer than anticipated. There is always a learning curve. We may need to persevere, adjust expectations, get help, or pivot. Luckily we are a small, flexible team who can come to consensus quickly, and move if necessary. Also, we rely on partners and trusted advisers for feedback in such circumstances.

## Projects

### How we work
LL expresses new dapp projects through design, technology, branding, user incentivization, and community development, using a repeatable process in a highly focused work environment.

LL is a team of highly specialized people. We each have a specific and complimentary skillset. Together we communicate a unified vision through technology and storytelling. 

#### Code + Design + Story, all communicating the same philosophical perspective in usable tech.

Approximately every 6 months LL begins work on a new idea. From that idea we create a plan of action that results in a minimum viable product (MVP) with a limited scope of features and deliverables. Then, the project is handed over to a production team with the goal of bringing it to market.

### Common deliverables per project might be: 
- A deployed version of the dapp
- A Github repo with
    - frontend code
    - contract code
    - protocol.md
    - white/yellow/pink paper
- Brand Guidelines + UX + Tone of Voice 
- Website
- How-to videos
- Development process / future roadmap
- Wireframes, Figma, Clickthrough
- Sustainability strategy
    - for bootstrapping the user community
    - for continuous development
- Research

### Projects / ideas are guided by these criteria
* [**Cypherpunk manifesto**](https://activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) 
* [**Open source FOSS manifesto**](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Everything_Manifesto)
* **Dieter Rams rules of design**
* **Empowering freedom of trade**: Trade is the peaceful solution to distributing goods and services.
* **Empowering voluntary interactions**: Peaceful interactions "is" the ability to Opt-in or out..
* **Empowering user's emotional well-being**: To transact value one must "feel" valuable.

### Initial roadmap
What we plan working on in what order:
- **Marketplace**: Decentralized marketplaces with built-in reputation
- **Tasks**: A UX designed specifically for individuals to earn by providing services for their communities.
- **Social**: experiments with social media
- **Shops**: Retail in a decentralized world, SilkRoad 4eVER 
- **Share**: Home and ride, with no middlemen
- **And more**!

## Delivery, Funding, and Reporting
LL intends to deliver 2 projects (as described above) per year for 3 years. Each project will begin with a plan and milestones, and will end with a defined set of deliverables.

At the start, the output might be slightly slower, but should be picked up in order to have 2 projects per year being delivered.

Every quarter, a report is made and presented to the world transparently. Whenever needed, the team is available to demo and present their work.
