# Introduction to Logos Innovation Lab

Logos Innovation Lab is a design and R&D studio working on innovating web3 products. It is part of the Logos ecosystem. 

Logos is a continuation of the original cypherpunk movement, advocating the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.

We believe trust-minimized technologies will pave the way to a world where more humane social institutions and fairer means of governance can emerge, and are accessible to anyone in the world with an internet connection.

We believe that technological advancements in cryptography and peer-to-peer networking will fundamentally change the way we organise our societies, and address many of pitfalls that are a direct result of ‘web 2.0’ services.

We imagine a future in which individuals have the ability to enforce their own property and privacy rights, have control over their own data and how its shared, and can voluntarily participate in new means of social and economic coordination.

Logos is an experiment to build this future, and is built and operated entirely by its open source community. Sharing our values and vision, you stumbled upon a place where technologists execute on their dreams.
